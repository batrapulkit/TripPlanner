Design and develop a full-stack Travel Planner AI web application that delivers end-to-end, hyper-personalized travel planning through an intelligent, modular, and scalable system. The frontend must support both multiple-choice questions and natural language input to gather detailed user preferences, including destination types, trip duration, budget, interests, travel pace, preferred activities, travel companions (solo/family/group), and seasonal or thematic filters (e.g., adventure, culture, relaxation). The UI should present 4â€“5 pre-built, AI-generated itinerary templates and enable dynamic, day-wise custom itinerary creation. The interface must be interactive and responsive, showcasing weather forecasts, flight and hotel options, maps, top attractions, local events, ticketed activities, dining spots, and travel tips. Users should be able to view and modify plans in real-time, create accounts, save travel histories, share itineraries via social media, and collaborate with others in planning trips. Include multilingual support and real-time alerts via push notifications, email, or SMS using services like Twilio or Firebase. The backend should use a modular, agent-based architecture for each task, including destination discovery, activity and attraction recommendations (Wikipedia API), event search (Serper API), flight and hotel search (Amadeus, Skyscanner APIs), and weather updates (WeatherAPI). Incorporate a machine learning-based recommender system for personalized destination and activity suggestions, and integrate an NLP-powered chatbot to assist users throughout the planning process. Ensure backend robustness with secure user authentication, session management, error handling, detailed API documentation, and support for offline data caching. Structure all output in clean, styled Markdown for frontend rendering. Future-proof the system for integration with AR/VR features, including AR-based navigation, landmark overlays, hotel/restaurant previews, real-time AR translation (OCR + camera input), immersive VR city tours, virtual itinerary previews, and collaborative social VR travel experiences using WebXR, Three.js, Unity, or ARKit/ARCore frameworks.
